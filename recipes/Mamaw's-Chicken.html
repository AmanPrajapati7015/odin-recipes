    <h1>Mamaw's Chicken and Rice Casserole</h1>
    <img src="../images/mamwa.jpg" alt="This is an image of cooked Mamaw's Chicken and Rice Casserole">
    <p>I grew up with this chicken and rice casserole recipe. My Grandmother got it from a lady from church at a pot luck a long time ago! She 
        passed it down to my mom and it's always been a family favorite. Quick and easy for school nights, and the leftovers are just as good! 
        You can use less butter on top of course, my Momma and Mamaw always put the full stick on top (gotta love Southern ladies and their 
        butter!)
